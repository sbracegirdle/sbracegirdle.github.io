Hi! I'm *Simon*, a Consultant and Software Developer from Perth, Western Australia working for [Mechanical Rock](https://mechanicalrock.io).

I've been developing software and helping teams with their practices and products for the past 15 years. During that time I've built a passion for writing, learning and educating. That's why I decided to create Let's Build for software development and cloud infrastructure content.

On this site I'll post anything from technical tutorials to architectural patterns. If I learnt something then I'll share it.

If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bracegirdle_me) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-bracegirdle/).

_**Thanks!**_
