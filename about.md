Hi! I'm *Simon*, a Consultant and Software Engineer from Perth, Western Australia. I currently work for [GovConnex](https://govconnex.com/), and previously worked for [Mechanical Rock](https://mechanicalrock.io) and [SEQTA Software](https://seqta.com.au).

I've been developing software and helping teams with their practices and products for over 15 years. During that time I've built an interest in writing, learning, and solving challenging problems. That's why I decided to create Let's Build, so that I had an outlet for sharing my thoughts and learnings relating to software and cloud infrastructure.

On this site I'll post anything from technical tutorials to my experiences with solving particular problems. If I learnt something then I'll share it.

If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bracegirdle_me) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-bracegirdle/).

_**Thanks!**_
