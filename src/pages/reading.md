# Reading list

I do enjoy sitting down and reading, or listening to, a good book. I like to get new ideas, perspectives, and narratives that stretch my understanding. 

Below are some summaries of books I'm reading or have finished.

## Current reads

### A Philosophy of Software Design — John Ousterhout

A book about software design concerns such as decomposition, modularity, and naming. It's a short book, but it's packed with useful information and advice. I'm enjoying it so far.

### The Bands of Mourning (Mistborn, #6) — Brandon Sanderson

The next book in the post-trilogy Mistborn series, also known as the Wax and Wayne books. I wasn't enjoying them as much as the original Mistborn series initially, but I'm starting to get into them now.

## Recent reads

### Origins: How Earth's History Shaped Human History — Lewis Dartnell

4/5

A book about the history of the Earth and how it has shaped human history. It gave a good overview of the origin of humans through to the development of civilisation.

### Shadows of Self (Mistborn, #5) — Brandon Sanderson

5/5

Another epic fantasy novel from Brandon Sanderson. I'm a big fan of his work, and this book was no exception. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series.

### Understanding Distributed Systems — Roberto Vitillo

3/5

A short book that provides a high-level overview of distributed systems. It's a good introduction to the topic, but I found it a bit too high-level for my liking.

### Fugitive Telemetry (The Murderbot Diaries, #6) — Martha Wells

**2/5**

The murderbot series is one of my favorite series of books. I've enjoyed the series so far, but I found this one a bit hard to get into.
