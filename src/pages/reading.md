# Reading list

When I step away from my computer, one of my favorite ways to unwind is by sitting down and reading, or listening to, a good book. Reading opens my mind to new ideas, perspectives, and narratives that stretch my understanding of the world and, often enough, offer valuable insights I can apply back in the realm of code. 

Below are some summaries of books I'm currently reading or have finished recently.

## Currently reading

### A Philosophy of Software Design — John Ousterhout

A book about software design concerns such as decomposition, modularity, and naming. It's a short book, but it's packed with useful information and advice. I'm enjoying it so far.

### Origins: How Earth's History Shaped Human History — Lewis Dartnell

A book about the history of the Earth and how it has shaped human history. I'm only a few chapters in, but it's been fascinating so far.

## Recent reads

### Shadows of Self (Mistborn, #5) — Brandon Sanderson

5/5

Another epic fantasy novel from Brandon Sanderson. I'm a big fan of his work, and this book was no exception. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series.

### Understanding Distributed Systems — Roberto Vitillo

3/5

A short book that provides a high-level overview of distributed systems. It's a good introduction to the topic, but I found it a bit too high-level for my liking.

### Fugitive Telemetry (The Murderbot Diaries, #6) — Martha Wells

**2/5**

The murderbot series is one of my favorite series of books. I've enjoyed the series so far, but I found this one a bit hard to get into.
