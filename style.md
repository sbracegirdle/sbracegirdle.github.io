# Writing style

I try to follow these guidelines in my writing:

- **Concise**: Be succinct and to the point, avoiding unnecessary verbosity.
- **Approachable**: Avoid complex jargon or elaborate language to ensure my writing is understandable.
- **Informal**: Maintain a casual tone, refraining from expressing strong or polarizing opinions.
- **Professional**: Be respectful and courteous, avoid any form of rudeness or offensive language.

I also generally follow the "write-good" linting practices, which means avoiding the following:

- *Passive Voice*: Passive voice can make sentences unclear or indirect. The linter flags uses of passive voice to encourage more direct and clear writing.
- *Lexical Illusions*: These are instances where a word is unintentionally used twice in a row. The linter identifies these to prevent confusing or awkward sentences.
- *So at the beginning of the sentence*: Starting a sentence with "so" can be seen as informal or conversational, which may not be appropriate for all types of writing.
- *Weasel Words*: These are words or phrases that are vague or misleading, such as "many", "various", "very", etc. The linter flags these to encourage more precise and honest writing.
- *Adverbs*: While not always bad, overuse of adverbs can lead to weak or redundant prose. The linter flags adverbs to encourage stronger, more direct verbs.
- *Clichés*: These are phrases that are overused and therefore may lack impact. The linter identifies clichés to encourage more original writing.
- *Repetition*: Repeating words or phrases can make writing redundant or boring. The linter flags repetition to encourage more varied and interesting prose.
- *Long Sentences*: Long sentences can be hard to read and understand. The linter flags sentences that are too long to encourage more concise and readable writing.
